This is a Demo dApp that allows you to manage your NFT's using EtherLink, a EVM compatible blockchain. 

The dApp is built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Hardhat.

Within this repository, you will find a folder for the frontend and a folder for smart contract deployment using hardhat. 

Current features include: 
- Connecting your MetaMask wallet
- Minting NFTs with custom names, descriptions, and images
- Transferring Minted NFTs to other wallets 
- Viewing all NFT's that you own

A live demo of the dApp can be found at: https://trilitech-theta.vercel.app 

Faucet tokens for the testnet can be requested from: https://faucet.etherlink.com

##### Install prerequisites

You will need to install the following prerequisites:
- Node.js v22.15.0 or higher 
- Npm v10.9.2 or higher
- Git

On Ubuntu: 
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm git 
```
On Windows: 
Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

On Mac:
```bash
brew install node git
```
Once Node.js and Npm are installed on the system, we can move on to customising and deplotying the smart contract and the frontend.

###### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduardstal/Trilitech .
```
___
#### 1. Setup instructions for contracts

```bash
cd Trilitech/contracts
```

‚ùóIf you are using Windows , you need to unlock running scripts from the PowerShell, as deploying using hardhat requires running a deploy script.
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
Finally, deploy the contract. You can find the contract address in the console output. Additionally, the ABI for the deployed contract can be found in `/contracts/artifacts/contracts/EtherLinkNFT.sol/EtherLinkNFT.json`
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network etherlink --verbose 
```
It is highly recommended to create a `.env` file to store the private key of the wallet that is deploying the contract. Do not follow my example, as it's not secure at all. A `.env.example` file can be found in the `/contracts` folder. 
___
#### 2. Setup instructions for the frontend

```bash
cd Trilitech/front_end
```
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Locally, the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
